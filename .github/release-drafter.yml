  ## Installation

  1. Download the installer below, named `tct-installer-VERSION.bsx`, where `VERSION` is replaced with the current version number.

  2. Upload the installer to your roboRIO. The directory you upload to doesn't matter but you should make note of it so you can find it again on the roboRIO. The admin user home directory (`/home/admin`) is a good choice.

  3. Note that all commands that you type at the roboRIO command-line in the following steps are **case-sensitive**.

  4. SSH into your roboRIO, locate the installer you just uploaded and run: `sh tct-installer-VERSION.bsx` to install TCT. This will extract and install a JAR file in `/usr/local/lib/tct.jar` and an executable script in `/usr/local/bin/tct`.

  5. You are done with the installer and may remove it: `rm tct-installer-VERSION.bsx`.

  6. TCT is now in the roboRIO path and can be run by typing `tct` at the roboRIO command line. You must have a Driver Station connected and robot enabled for motors to run. Also, we recommend you don't run your tct ssh program (i.e. PuTTY) on the same laptop as the Driver Station since typing can cause the robot to disable or e-stop.
